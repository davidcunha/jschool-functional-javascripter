# Functional JavaScripter

Functions are a first-class citizen in JavaScript. Functional Programming is a declarative programming paradigm that avoids changing state, reducing complexity, side-effects, and making the code more readable.

In this chapter, we'll learn fundamental functional programming features, such as map, reduce, filter and others!

## Install Node.js

Make sure Node.js is installed on your computer.

Install it from [nodejs.org](https://nodejs.org/)

On Windows and using v4 or v5 of Node.js? Make sure you are using at least 5.1.0, which provides a fix for a bug on Windows where you can't choose items in the menu.

### Install `jschool-functional-javascripter` with `npm`

Open your terminal and run this command:

```
npm install --global jschool-functional-javascripter
```

The `--global` option installs this module globally so that you can run it as a command in your terminal.

#### Having issues with installation?

If you get an `EACCESS` error, the simplest way to fix this is to rerun the command, prefixed with sudo:

```
sudo npm install --global jschool-functional-javascripter
```

You can also fix the permissions so that you don't have to use `sudo`. Take a look at this npm documentation:
https://docs.npmjs.com/getting-started/fixing-npm-permissions
